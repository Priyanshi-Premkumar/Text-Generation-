0,"The screen is not durable. It gets spoilt within a short time and samsung will not repair under warranty.If you search the net you will find large number of similar grievance about the folding screen and Samsungs refusal to repair under warranty, immaterial of what they claim in their advertising"
1,"Screen protector needs to be replaced every 4-5 months of normal usage.... Bending glass breaks if particles get in between the screen guard and glass screen...Battery drains pretty fast.warranty - says 1 year warranty for phone.....but when asked samsung service centre, they say its only for 10 months....i had gone to extend warranty coz of screen issues but couldnt do it...."
2,"With less than a year, there was a folding mark at the centre of my screen, with no fault whatsoever from my end. Samsung repaired but have not given me any guarantee that it will not reoccur. So I spent a lakh on a phone which started showing defects with the warranty period and now post the warranty period, if the same problem recurs I have no option but to throw away this phone. Samsung is making a fool out of its customers. Other than this most crucial issue, the battery is very poor. Rest is great but because of this major defect, which will make it difficult to read what's on screen, this is certainly not worth it. This was a big mistake from my end to buy this phone."
3,The form factor is its coolest feature. It's a conversation starter and personally it gives me immense pleasure to play around with a flipping phone. The speakers are amazing and perfect for video conferences. The battery won't last long so I've got a charger in my home car and office which gives me enough juice. Truth be told it's almost always kept in charging mode.It's a delicate ladies phone mind you. My screen developed a terrifying Crack in the middle of the screen. I was told the screen protector has cracked. Gurus said don't remove the protector.I did remove it as the phone looked so bad with that white Crack. Yes I removed the screen protector and the PHONE WORKS FINE. Truth is you don't need a screen gaurd as the phone remains folded most of the times so it doesn't get scratched so much. So pl remove the protector but it will zilch your warranty.The fold in the middle of the screen is minimal. I got used to it pretty quickly and hardly notice it these days.Will I buy this again?Ummm I'll buy a fold phone if it becomes more affordable as it's cooler looking and I'm not really an advanced user anyways. I like the 8inch form factor of the fold and that I can attach a foldable bt keyboard to it to make it a teeny tiny tablet / pc ...let's see. Other than that I might wait for the flip to become more durable n sturdy and with better battery lifeLet's face it We are stuck to our phones all day. And it's nice to stare at something pretty isn't it :)
4,I have fold 3 as well as flip 3! Both are less than six month old and have got patchy spots on the screen without any fall and with utmost care! Samsung iconic mobile range is worst! Never buy expensive samsung mobile
5,"Buying this phone is a mistake. If you have researched thoroughly about this phone, you will know the flip screen isn't perfect and it has touch issues. However carefully you use it, the touch is going to be defective. I have treated this phone like a baby since it's my graduation present after 4 years and the most expensive thing I have ever splurged on. However this didn't even last 3 months, forget a year. And if you're thinking customer service is always there, they will help out. I thought so too but with no results. Despite my exams I went to the service centre thrice and there was no physical damage when the screen touch issues were shown to the service centre but they refused saying it's takes time, come tomorrow and then engineer is not available and so on. Finally after 2 months, it's refused. So yeah,  your phone is going to be down the drain if you buy it because no one is coming to help if it gets damaged. They are charging exorbitant amounts 50k to repair the screen. I don't know what to do with this phone now. Should have brought trusted brands rather than this. It's so scary that 90k phone is not going to be used. WHAT am I supposed to do now?? Its EMI is still being paid."

8,"I am using this phone from 6 months, I did not buy it from Amazon but would like other people to avoid this phone. The phone as per it's cost is very bad in performance.Battery : It works for 12-14 Hours on full charge, battery starts to drain very quickly once it's around 15%. Very poor battery life.Performance: Phone's Performance is overall fine, have a few lags and they are from day 1.Camera : Front camera is average and the rear camera doesn’t perform well against the phones in this range.Durability: It's very fragile, my phone has a dead cell on its screen, when I raised it to the service center, they said I punctured my screen by some sharp object. I use my phone with so much care, but still it doesn't help out.
