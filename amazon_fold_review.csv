0,"The big screen is the greatest attraction to read documents and email attachments and watch videos. The specs are good, but only to be expected for such an expensive phone. Battery life is ok, nothing spectacular. Same with the camera, there are better camera phones. The flip cover and the pen is a good accessory to buy, but the cover is not designed properly, it slides flat when you try to use it as a stand to place it on the table to watch videos. One needs to put a stopper to prevent this.The screen when the phone is closed is narrower than regular phones, and therefore the displays get jumbled up and become unreadable. Very disappointing for such an expensive phone.Verdict: Good only if you want a crossover between a phone and a tablet in one gadget to read documents on the go. Other than that, difficult to justify the price tag."
1,"My husband is usung the phone and he is just loving it. We are impressed with the overall performance and durability of the phone. The technology implemented in the phone gives an awesome experience. Others might talk about battery life and camera. The rear camera clicks very nice photo, the front camera is good too. The UDC serves our basic purpose of attending video calls and we have no issues with the quality of the images it produce. The battery stays for a day with one full charge in the morning, sometimes gets exhausted before the day ends due to heavy usage. It could have been improved but still is not a big issue. Because everyday we do not need to remain fully engaged in our phone.  The overall user experience provided by the phone is premium as there are many too-good features in the phone. It is a luxury possessing the phone and we are fully up to it."
2,"Its a super premium phone. Feels durable. Its cost seems justified. Front screen is great for one hand usage. And main screen is good for 2 hand usage. Spen should have been inbuilt. Should have bundled something for pre booking customers.Pros : screen, touch, hardware, camera, multi talking, biggest screen which folds, ipx8, creates envy in others and is owners pride.Cons: i had a one plus 5t earlier.  All points are compared to that. battery doesn't last long. Finger print and face scanner are not that responsive, adaptor should have been provided.4 stars as battery is really not sufficient till evening with normal usage."
3,"Pros:1) Large internal screen is the main USP, helps you improve productivity significantly. Very useful while multitasking, reading, watching videos etc. Once you get addicted to this, there's no going back to the normal slab phone.2) Front screen is useful for on the go minor things3) Very sturdy device, has fell twice in the last 15 days (closed mode) but there's not even a scratch4) Taking selfies using back camera is a unique and super useful feature.5) Apps work smoothly in split screen6) Style statement: Due to unique nature of the phone, your device will get noticed by peopleCons1) Keyboard: Samsung keyboard has its drawbacks and gboard, while his enough, doesn't have split mode2) Annoying Samsung apps (can be disabled)3) Battery life is a bit of a dampener considering the phone is very powerful and won't last for a day if usage has been heavyFeatures I have not explored yet1) S pen, which looks handy in videos. However there is no slot for s pen within the phone2) Dex mode"
4,"Excellent phone The user experience is also very nice , But the main problem Is about it's longitivity  I hope It's hinges Stays in good  Position Now coming to the camera quality The quality seems to be very perfectThe type of screen used in this phone is also very good quality Colors are looking very natural It also feels a little heavy But I don't have any problem with it Companies should make a cheaper version of the coverBecause the cover in itself is of the prize the price that a person can purchase a new low segment smartphone in it."
5,"There is a thick black line of dead pixels running thru the centre of the phone less than 6months after I purchased this phone. Service team found a dent and says the warranty of the phone is therefore invalid.Charges for repairing what is obviously a mfrg defect is 40k. Big and expensive mistake to buy this phoneBattery : 6minths after purchase, I am having to charge this phone twice in a day. Not cool, samsung."
